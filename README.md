Cryptocurrency trade is growing rapidly and has expanded to almost every part of the earth. The exchange market for cryptocurrency is similar to the stock market and forex market, where traders can trade company stocks, commodities or fiat currencies. However, the stock market and forex have many limitations such as the duration of trading, stock trading regulations, investment rules, trading strategy rules, brokerage rules and fraud, arbitration, and the legal principles of each country.
This makes it difficult for ordinary people to gain access, and there will always be third parties with high costs among traders and markets. The cryptocurrency exchange market has no access restrictions and is very transparent at a very low cost; it is open to every individual, strategy, language, region and country in any part of the world as long as it is connected to the internet.
